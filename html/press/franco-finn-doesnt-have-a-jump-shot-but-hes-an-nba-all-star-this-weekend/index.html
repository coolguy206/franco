            SAN FRANCISCO -- While the Golden State Warriors will be getting a much-needed break this All-Star Week,
            <span>Franco Finn</span> will be busy representing the Bay Area at the game in Utah.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finn's appearance has nothing to do with a jumpshot or the ability to drive to the basket. It's his
            booming
            voice, a familiar feature of the Chase Center game-time experience, that has earned him the cherish role
            of the
            in-arena voice of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finn has been holding the microphone for 20 years, getting fans hyped up and introducing the Warriors
            before
            every game.
        </p>

        <p>
            This year, his vocal skills will be center stage and he's waited a long time for this opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>
            "It really does mean a lot to me, it's not just the All-Star Game and all the glitz and glamour, to host
            it on
            that stage, " Finn said.&nbsp; "I belong, I made it, I represent a lot, not just the Bay Area, Dub
            Nation, but
            my Filipino culture."
        </p>

        <p>
            Finn grew up loving basketball, something he bonded over with his mom. They spent a lot of time together
            watching games.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
            His mom, Angeles Finn, is an immigrant from the Philippines and has been a big fan of the Warriors since
            she
            moved here in the early 70's.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Franco</span> never thought his voice would get him courtside but he's grateful he made the choice to
            take on
            challenge 20 years ago.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;"Harlem Globetrotters, I flew to Phoenix, they auditioned me, I was ready to go, but I had the
            Warriors
            who said we need a commitment, you can't just be here for one or two games, we need you for the whole
            season."
            Finn said. "I went with my gut I knew she (his mom) needed me here, and this is my home."
        </p>

            Finn said. "I went with my gut I knew she (his mom) needed me here, and this is my home."
        </p>

        <p>
            Covering the Warriors has been a lot of fun and he has done his best to bring the hype and excitement to
            the
            arena.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
            He's also very proud of his heritage and wants to highlight that during the All-Star Game festivities,
            by
            paying homage to his Filipino roots with the clothing he'll wear.

            "This jacket is actually a dedication to the AAPI community, that's huge, they are huge Warriors fans
            and I
            thought I have to wear it at All Star," Finn said.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to working with the Warriors, <span>Franco</span> also keeps busy as an emcee and an auctioneer,
            among
            other
            things.&nbsp;

            His most important job of course, is taking care of his mom who suffered a stroke, and even survived
            breast
            cancer and COVID. &nbsp;
