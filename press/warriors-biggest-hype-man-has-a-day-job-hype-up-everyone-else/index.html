        <p>For <span>Franco Finn</span>, winding down is the hardest part.</p>

        <p>
            The build up is easy, when he enters the proverbial phone booth and
            transforms from a mere mortal into the Golden State Warriors’ deafening,
            larger-than-life emcee.
        </p>

        <p>
            “It doesn’t take much for me to be excited about the Warriors,” Finn, a San
            Francisco native, told The Examiner shortly after the team was <a
                href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/sports/warriors/for-warriors-a-decade-has-changed-everything--and-nothing/article_1b590552-f437-11ed-9127-6b85d091d087.html"
                target="_blank">eliminated from the playoffs</a>. That part comes
            naturally.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most difficult period of his job is the come down at the end, he said;
            the transition into the offseason, to a life bereft of the adrenaline high
            that comes with being Stephen Curry’s biggest hype man.
        </p>

        <p>
            But he never really unwinds. “I don’t turn it down,” he said with a laugh.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you’ve been to a Warriors game this millennium, you’ve undoubtedly
            experienced Finn. Whether it’s his voice blaring through Chase Center’s
            booming speaker system or his many appearances on the venue’s 10,000-foot
            jumbotron, he’s hard to miss.
        </p>

        <p>
            For two decades, he’s been entrusted with rousing up 20,000 Warriors fans
            every home game, first at Oracle Arena and now across the Bay in his
            hometown.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finn, 46, serves as the Warriors’ in-arena host, a position he’s held far
            longer than the only other two people to have the job. You may see him
            interviewing people in the stands during commercial breaks, <a
                href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/sports/warriors/warriors-unveil-simu-liu-sensory-room-at-chase-center/article_0be8938e-a70d-11ed-87ee-bb1960bf3566.html"
                target="_blank">ringing the ceremonial cable car bell</a> with a
            celebrity guest at center court, or telling fans to rise to their feet
            before a dramatic late-game moment.
        </p>

        <p>
            But his job crescendos minutes before tip-off when he revs up the crowd and
            team by introducing the starting lineup — the most sacred sermon of any NBA
            arena announcer. It’s his job to “start the engine,” he said.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Wa-Wa-Wa-Warriors fans! Iiiiit’s go time! Let’s get hyped and make some
            noiiiiise!” he bellows before launching into naming, one by one, which five
            Warriors are about to take the floor.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BiLR3OAH8U&amp;pp=ygUid2FycmlvcnMgaW50cm9kdWN0aW9ucyBmaW5hbHMgMjAyMg"
                target="_blank">During the playoffs</a>, his histrionics can be so
            intense that Finn — who’s introduced the Warriors’ dynastic core of Curry,
            Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green before every game they’ve played in the
            Bay Area — has come close to passing out.
        </p>

        <p>
            His theatrics are widely praised in NBA circles, stamped with approval by
            current and former Warriors players, coaches, and front office staff. Even
            Toronto Raptors minority owner, basketball enthusiast and <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0PZYWA4LoM&amp;pp=ygUIMCB0byAxMDA" target="_blank">“Chef
                Curry with the pot”</a> lyricist Drake has
            complimented him on his thunderous intros.
        </p>

        <p>
            But basketball season is temporary. Even for the best teams — as the <a
                href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/our_sections/fanfare/mission-accomplished-warriors-close-out-celtics-to-reclaim-nba-crown/article_ec2c0c12-ede2-11ec-9319-eb9bae8e6e17.html"
                target="_blank">Warriors have often been over the past decade</a> — it
            ends in mid-June. Or, as it did for this year’s Warriors, the campaign
            abruptly halts a month earlier.
        </p>

        <p>
            So where does that leave Finn, with so much excess energy to spare and no
            Warriors games to spend it on?
        </p>

        <p>
            If the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udKE1ksKWDE&amp;pp=ygURYWx3YXlzIGFuZ3J5IGh1bGs"
                target="_blank">Incredible Hulk’s secret</a> is he’s always angry, then
            Finn’s secret is he’s always a hype man, both inside Chase Center’s halls
            and beyond them.
        </p>

        <p>
            His Warriors gig is only part-time. He spends most of his working life as the
            community activations lead for Alaska Airlines, where he’s been employed the
            last 10 years. If the job description sounds vague and broad, that’s because
            it’s supposed to be. Finn is, in more ways than one, indescribable.
        </p>

        <p>
            “My job is to be the face of Alaska Airlines,” Finn said. “Any big
            activations, big launches, whatever we need to jazz up the brand like I do
            with the Warriors, I do with Alaska Airlines as well.”
        </p>

        <p>
            In the simplest terms, Finn is Alaska Airlines’ emcee — the master of
            ceremonies for any and all ceremonies that need mastering. The airline
            created the position especially for Finn, tailored to fit his zestful
            personality.
        </p>

        <p>
            “You can’t put <span>Franco</span> in a box. If that happened, I’d feel bad for the box,”
            said Marilyn Romano, one of Alaska Airlines’ vice presidents and a friend of
            Finn.
        </p>

        <p>
            When Alaska Airlines unveils a new route or has sponsorship appearances at
            events like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFuLlaISs5w" target="_blank">San Francisco
                Pride</a> and <a
                href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/culture/carnaval-re-emerges-after-2-year-hiatus-to-celebrate-s-f-s-melting-pot/article_d4949e6c-dd42-11ec-bd92-df18ac330b4e.html"
                target="_blank">Carnavale San Francisco</a>, it’s Finn’s job to bring
            them to life.
        </p>

        <p>
            “He brings the excitement and the fun to anything that we’re doing,” Romano
            said. “He takes it to the next level.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Take this example: Romano said the company hosts
            events called “Surprise and Delight Flights,” where they’ll
            spontaneously appear at the gate of a flight and add something special
            to the experience — like the debut of a newly painted aircraft. It could
            be the first flight of the morning or a redeye. That’s when they’ll send
            Finn to the airport gate to greet the unsuspecting passengers to spice
            up the event.
        </p>

        <p>
            “There’s nothing funnier than watching people at the
            gate of a 6 a.m. flight&nbsp;—
            where passengers are tired and only looking for coffee — and then you
            start hearing this loud, happy voice. The last thing you think you want
            to do that early is breakdance with <span>Franco Finn</span>. But then you find
            yourself doing that,” Romano said. “He’s there giving away tickets or
            t-shirts, he’s going up to kids and getting them excited. That’s what he
            does. He brings that joy to what would normally be just another
            flight.”
        </p>

        <p>
            As if his responsibilities with the Warriors
            and Alaska Airlines weren’t enough, Finn also triples up as a freelance
            auctioneer, contracted by some of the Bay Area’s biggest Asian American and
            Pacific Islander nonprofits.
        </p>

        <p>
            He’s auctioned off hundreds of experiences and
            pieces of memorabilia in his career. The most lucrative items include a
            $50,000 Warriors basketball autographed by the 2015 championship team, a
            $100,000 private concert by singer Michael Franti, and an $80,000 Will
            Ferrell golf pack.
        </p>

        <p>
            His auctioning exploits have grown so
            renowned, he’s earned the moniker, the “hype man auctioneer.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “I’m a hype man for hire,” Finn, a self-described hustler, said to sum up his
            multi-headed career.
        </p>

        <p>
            Three different jobs, all sewn together by a common thread: Finn’s
            unrelenting appetite for uplifting others. “He’s just one person, but he’s
            got the energy of 20 people,” Romano said.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I have many hands in many cookie jars,” Finn admitted. “It has definitely
            been a juggling act. But hey, when you’re the voice of the Bay Area and
            you’re being called upon, it’s an honor. Because I use my talents for the
            greater good.”

                    “You can’t put <span>Franco</span> in a box. If that happened, I’d feel bad
                    for the box,” Marilyn Romano, one of Alaska Airlines’ vice
                    presidents and a friend of Finn, said.

            Finn credited his nonstop zeal to his Filipino heritage. “Filipinos have been
            so adaptable,” he said. “I’m a pleaser, in many ways. I just like to make
            people happy. If you talk to the average Filipino, they make something out
            of nothing. They may not have much, but they make the most out of what they
            have.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “Being humble, respectful, treating people how you
            want to be treated. That’s who I am. It comes from my Asian culture.
            It’s my foundation and DNA,” he said.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finn is the only Asian American emcee across
            all 30 NBA clubs. For a sport so widely embraced by
            Asians across the globe, they are sparsely represented among its media
            and front-facing figures.
        </p>

        <p>
            More Filipino Americans are arriving on the scene though, including guards
            Jordan Clarkson of the Utah Jazz and Jalen Green of the Houston Rockets.
            Erik Spoelstra, the first Asian American head coach in any of the four major
            North American sports leagues, is currently leading the Miami Heat in the
            NBA Finals. Cassidy Hubbarth is a frequent host and sideline reporter for
            ESPN’s NBA coverage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finn's Filipino roots are what brought him to
            basketball in the first place. His mother, Angeles Lucente, immigrated to
            San Francisco from the Philippines in the 1970s. Finn called basketball her
            “entree” into the U.S., the first feature of Americana she fully embraced.
            She shared that love with Finn, and the sport became their “connector.” The
            two would spend night after night watching the Warriors from their Excelsior
            district home, the only time Finn was allowed to stay up past his bedtime.
        </p>

        <p>
            His hype man origin story started a bit later when
            he became the student body spirit commissioner as a senior at Sacred
            Heart Cathedral Prep. That’s where he discovered his powers, stirring up
            his classmates before sports games or rallies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finn’s big break came at one of his earliest jobs
            out of college. He was an emcee for Radio Disney, warming up crazed
            teenagers before concerts for mega pop stars like Britney Spears, the
            Backstreet Boys, and Christina Aguilera.
        </p>

        <p>
            When he was 25, after rousing up the Oakland
            Coliseum prior to a Hilary Duff show, he was approached backstage. It
            was a high-ranking Warriors business staffer who had been in the crowd
            with his family.
        </p>

        <p>
            “God, you commanded that audience,” Finn remembers
            the team official telling him. “We need a hype guy. Like you.”
        </p>

        <p>
            That opened the door for him to audition for the
            vacancy. Twenty years later, Finn has become a hallmark of the team that
            brought him and his mom together.
        </p>

        <p>
            “This is the American dream,” Finn said. “My
            job is a symbol of what my mom wanted for her son when she immigrated here.”
        </p>

        <p>
            It’s fitting that the two primary voices at Chase
            Center are Finn, an Asian American, and Matt Pitman, the only openly gay
            public address announcer in the NBA.
        </p>

        <p>
            “What a perfect backdrop,” Finn said of his and
            Pitman’s unique dynamic. “There’s no judgment here. We have such a
            diverse population. And I embrace it and will continue to be a voice for
            the community.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “I think it’s a natural fit. Of course it would be
            here in the Bay,” Pitman said. “The Warriors understand that more than
            any other organization. Having people in every role who reflect the many
            colors, stripes, orientations of the Bay Area community is important to
            them. Our pairing is significant in that way.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Finn hopes his journey has blazed the trail
            for more people who look like him to pursue professions where they’ve
            historically been underrepresented.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I do it because I love it. I knew from a young age
            this is what I wanted to do, and I just happen to be Filipino American,”
            he said. “Filipinos are stereotypically a nurse or a doctor. It’s nice
            to be someone that’s helping to break the bamboo ceiling.”
        </p>

        <p>
            He frequently receives messages from fans in the
            Philippines who watch the Warriors on NBA League Pass — where the
            in-arena entertainment is shown during the commercial breaks — from
            either young people thanking him for paving the way, thrilled to see
            someone with their heritage take center stage on the NBA’s platform, or
            parents saying their children mimic his electric introductions.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I’m living proof that when you put your mind
            to it, don’t let anything stop you,” he said. “If it’s something you love
            and you’re passionate about, you’ve got to trust that gut instinct.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “I created my own path. It’s unconventional, but
            that plays into who I am.”
        </p>
