                SAN FRANCISCO — Because professional hype man Franco Finn has
                been so loud for so long, the pulsing soundtrack of the <a class="ath_autolink"
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/team/warriors/">Warriors</a>
                dynasty sometimes gets recognized in public. They may not
                know his face, but his voice rings a decibel.
            </p>
            <p>
                It happens sometimes at Costco. Finn will say something
                innocuous to his wife — “Can you believe these peaches?” —
                and suddenly a stranger’s head will swivel, eyes widening.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Someone from another aisle will turn and say, ‘Oh, my God! I
                knew it was you!'” Franco said. “Like, they can hear me
                across the way.”
            </p>
            <p>
                If he really wanted to blow his cover, he could … just talk
                louder. Because for two decades, the Alaska Airlines
                employee by day has been the Warriors’ sultan of shout by
                night. His official duties for home games include belting
                out pregame announcements, bellowing starting lineups and
                beseeching 18,000 fans to make noise. He’s the guy the
                Warriors count on to <a href="https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/more-cowbell/3506001"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bring more
                    cowbell</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This weekend, though, the roles are reversed. The <a class="ath_autolink"
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/">NBA</a>
                is giving <em>him</em> a shout-out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finn was selected for All-Star duty in Salt Lake City, an honor
                he’s been craving for years in part because of the poignant
                footnote that comes with it. He’s the first Asian American
                to be tapped for the role. The son of Filipino immigrants
                will serve as the in-arena emcee for the Rising Stars
                Challenge on Friday and All-Star Saturday Night featuring
                the slam-dunk contest, 3-point showdown and skills
                challenge.

                It’s enough to make even a hype man take a few extra seconds to
                find the right words. Finn feels this moment for his fellow
                Filipino Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I wear that proudly, and I wear that on my sleeve,” Finn said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finn’s mother, Angeles Lucente, is from the Philippines. The
                stepfather who helped raise him, the late George Finn, was
                Irish.&nbsp;Finn, 46, knows from experience that people
                across the globe watch Warriors basketball on NBA League
                Pass, and he gets emails from fans in the Philippines.
                Parents send Finn videos of their children mimicking his
                starting-lineup theatrics. He knows there are fans in Asia
                who will watch the NBA All-Star festivities in part because
                of his groundbreaking appearance.
            </p>

            <p>
                “I have a lot on my shoulders,” Finn said. “These kids are like
                6, 7, 8 years old, and they literally copy my introduction.
                It’s so flattering, an honor. And they’re like, ‘Oh my God!
                You’re in the NBA! You introduce <a class="ath_autolink"
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/stephen-curry-toS7DgUD3IIt7uds/">Steph
                    Curry</a> every night!’ They love Warriors basketball
                in Asia. And in the Philippines, they in particular love
                Steph Curry. He’s right there with Manny Pacquiao. There are
                little kids in the Philippines right now who can shoot
                lights out. They’re shooting 3s.”

                Actor Vin Diesel will handle the player intros for the All-Star
                Game on Sunday, but if they need an idea for yet another
                sequel to the “Fast &amp; Furious” collection, they could
                just follow Finn around for a night, as <em>The
                    Athletic</em> did before the Warriors’ game against <a class="ath_autolink"
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/team/thunder/">Oklahoma
                    City</a> on Feb. 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finn’s over-the-top energy is not an act. He walks as if
                leading a fast break and talks as if he has amps for lungs.
                Our Q&amp;A was mostly just A. I asked Finn if he was
                caffeinated.
            </p>
            <p>“No,” he shrugged. “This is just how I am.”</p>
            <p>
                In this job, the kinetic pace is a plus, even three hours
                before tipoff. Finn’s night starts with a production meeting
                with 10 or so other members of the so-called Dub Squad. Finn
                comes equipped with a clipboard and a healthy stack of index
                cards filled out with mini-scripts for each of his
                promotional announcements. He later would ignore every
                single card because he commits them to memory with
                preternatural ease.
            </p>
            <p>“These are just props,” he said of the stack.</p>
            <p>
                It’s hectic on this Monday evening because it’s “Bruce Lee
                Night,” and the daughter of the martial arts icon, Shannon
                Lee, is in the house for the occasion. Also there is Simu
                Liu, the star of the Marvel movie “Shang-Chi and the Legend
                of the Ten Rings,” who is scheduled to ring the ritual
                pregame bell at midcourt and needs a rousing introduction.

                “That’ll be a great pic if you want to grab any photos,” the
                helpful hype man says. “Because you never know who’s going
                to stop by — celebrities, dignitaries, politicians,
                athletes.”&nbsp;Indeed, notable bell ringers since Chase
                Center opened include actress Rita Moreno, actor Jon Hamm,
                rapper E-40, San Francisco Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford
                … and Santa Claus.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the real stars are the Warriors players, which is why Finn
                treats the starting lineups on his clipboard as sacred text.
                He writes them out by hand, a superstition he said in
                explaining why the Warriors have won four NBA titles since
                the 2014-15 season.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This is the good luck,” said Finn, tapping his lineup notes.
                “I think this is why the Warriors win championships, because
                I literally handwrite every single intro. It’s never typed.
                I handwrite.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You see how ratty this is? It’s because this is the starting
                lineup from our championship years, and I haven’t changed
                it. It stays with me all day.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, the notes really do come in handy. Players care
                how they are introduced and sometimes offer stage
                directions. Finn used to introduce former center Andrew
                Bogut “from the University of Utah” until the 7-footer
                pulled him aside one day and said, “Mate, can you do me a
                favor?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Bogut wanted the hype man to switch out his college in favor of
                his hometown of Melbourne, Australia, and he wanted
                Melbourne pronounced with an Australian accent, not with the
                Americanized ending that sounds like ‘“born.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “He said, ‘Can you say from <em>Mel-bun</em>, Australia? You
                gotta say it like that. <em>Mel-bun</em>, Australia,'” Finn
                said. “I never used the Utah introduction again.”
            </p>
            <p>
                These days, he doesn’t have favorite names so much as he has
                favorite initials. Give him a last name that starts with a
                “P” or a “B,” and he’s got a runway cleared for takeoff.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh, yeah. Jordan <em>puh-puh-puh-</em>Poole! I love to do the
                little emphasis on the P,'” Finn said. “When we had <a class="ath_autolink"

                    Looney</a>! Looney is a fun one, too. In the middle. I
                extend the ‘<em>Loooooooney</em>,’ and everyone does that,
                right?”

                In most NBA arenas, the public-address announcer handles the
                glamorous starting lineup duties. For the PA peeps, that’s
                the time to shine, the proverbial isolation play at crunch
                time. But years ago, Finn elbowed his way into the role
                almost by accident. He was summoned to a corporate breakfast
                function at the Marriott Hotel that trotted out Coach Don
                Nelson and the rest of the players.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finn was there as an emcee. On a lark, he said, organizers
                asked Finn if he could do the player introductions in
                starting-lineup style, and he channeled his inner Michael
                Buffer.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I did the entire roster,” Finn said. “I didn’t realize that
                was an audition. That breakfast event ended up making me the
                actual introduction guy for the team. They said, ‘Why don’t
                you start doing the starting lineup now.’ And I said, ‘Wait,
                you want me to do this during all the games?’
            </p>
            <p>“I have to tell you, it has opened up so many doors for me.”</p>

                transforms into an alter ego when he
                gets in front of a big crowd. It’s
                come naturally to him since high
                school. (Courtesy: Golden State
                Warriors)

            <p>Do purists at the game ever tell him to pipe the hell down?</p>
            <p>
                “All the time,” Finn said. “You’ve got all the curmudgeons that
                are diehard basketball fans. ‘Hey, why do you play music?
                Why is there always a loud guy in my ear? I just want to
                watch the game!’
            </p>
            <p>
                “You’re never gonna please the people, the fundamentalists who
                just love the game. But what I tell people is: Look, the NBA
                is an experience. It’s entertainment. It’s more than just
                the game. When timeouts happen, my show is the show within
                the show.”
            </p>
            <p>
                As a senior at Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep in San Francisco,
                his classmates voted him as the student body spirit
                commissioner. Until then, Finn was oblivious to his destiny.
                But he was soon called upon to whip up the crowd before a
                game against longtime rival St. Ignatius College Prep.
            </p>
            <p>He said there were probably 1,200 students in the gym.</p>
            <p>
                “I’m like any teenage kid. I didn’t want to speak in front of
                my peers,” Finn said. “But you know what? I did a pretty
                good job. I remember I was dressed up as Deion Sanders with
                a headband, and I pretended I was Prime Time. I had this
                alter ego … like flash! Dash! Energy! That was awesome. And
                from then on, I kinda said, ‘Oh, this public speaking thing?
                I guess I can do it.”
            </p>

            <p>
                His big breakout after graduating with a communications degree
                from Santa Clara University in 1999 involved hyping pop
                sensations. Warming up the crowds for the likes of NSYNC,
                the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera
                prepared him for his future of working alongside NBA rock
                stars. Finn’s main job then was at Radio Disney, where his
                early duties included promotion, production and sales.

                But his specialty was live events, and his world changed thanks
                to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmgJhRVwzt0" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bay
                    Area concert stop by Hilary Duff</a>, the actress and
                singer of “Lizzie McGuire” fame.
            </p>
            <p>
                Duff performed at the Oakland Coliseum that year. There was no
                opening act. It was just Finn — as “Duff-man,” wandering
                around the stage and geeking up the crowd, much of it
                ad-libbed. By the time Duff came out for her opening number,
                it was closer to pandemonium than Nickelodeon.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it turns out, several Warriors executives were in the crowd
                with their children. They found Finn backstage and asked him
                to audition to be the in-arena host for the upcoming season.
            </p>
            <p>“The rest is history,” Finn said.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                When he’s really rolling, when he’s vanished fully into his
                alter ego like Superman stepping out of a phone booth,
                Finn’s body pulsates with an ambient noise. It’s right
                around the 7 p.m. PT tipoff, and Finn is bouncing up and
                down behind the scorer’s table, holding the microphone and
                watching the hand signal that serves as his cue.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he gets it, Finn’s vocal pyrotechnics begin. It’s poetry
                on steroids.
            </p>

            <p class="em">
                <em>DUB NATION</em><br>
                <em>ARE YOU READY?</em><br>
                <em>WAH-WAH-WAH-WARRIORS</em><br>
                <em>ITTTTT’S, GO TIME!</em><br>
                <em>LET’S GET UP AND MAKE SOME NOI-SE!</em><br>

            <p>
                Then he introduces the players one by one, with <a class="ath_autolink"

                    Green</a> giving way to <a class="ath_autolink"

                    Wiggins</a> to Jordan <em>puh-puh-puh-</em>Poole and
                down the line. The sound is guttural and raw, as if it
                starts from somewhere in Finn’s previous life. This is the
                stuff that screams are made of.
            </p>

            <p>
                The crowd is indeed hyped. When he’s done, Finn calmly daps a
                few friendly fists and returns to human form.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a journey that began when Angeles, a recent widow,
                arrived in the Bay Area from the Philippines in the 1970s.
                She moved here just in time for the Warriors’ first NBA
                title in 1975 and embraced American culture by becoming a
                basketball fan in the age of Rick Barry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finn was born in 1977, and it should be no surprise that he was
                a hyper kid. He said didn’t want to go to sleep … like,
                ever. He wanted to stay up, conveniently ignoring that he
                had school in the morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                So mother and son struck a deal. “You can stay up as long as
                the Warriors game is on. And then you can go to sleep. Is
                that a deal?” she told him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Angeles now is 76 and still living in San Francisco. She won’t
                be able to make the trip to the All-Star Game festivities
                this weekend, but it’s safe to say her son will be wide
                awake and on full alert. Thanks to his historic duties, so
                will everybody else in the crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am literally working for my home team, my dream team that my
                mom introduced to me since I was a kid,” Finn said. “I’m a
                son of an immigrant who came here for the American dream.
                And I’m living the American dream right now. It’s just been
                amazing.”
            </p>
